Use special keyword `:rest:` to match all unused/uncached assets. To match multiple assets or assets with dynamic names, use [pattern matching](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch). **Any section can contain any assets, not only those which are generated by the _webpack_ build.** However, "_pattern matching_" is executed only against generated assets. When external asset is included you will receive warning about it (missing from generated assets) unless it's explicitly marked as _external_ via `externals` option.
    * `main` cache. Assets listed in this section are cached first (via `install` event in `ServiceWorker`) and if caching of this section fails -- no assets are cached at all. Hence, it should contain minimal set of assets, for example `['index.html', 'main.js']`.
    * `additional` cache. Assets in this section are loaded after `main` section is successfully loaded. In `ServiceWorker` this section is loaded in `activate` event. If any of assets fails to download, then nothing is cached from the `additional` section and all the assets are moved to the `optional` section. If **current update strategy** is `changed`, then only failed to download assets are moved to the `optional` section, all other are successfully cached.
    * `optional` cache. This sections **is only supported** by `ServiceWorker`. As you may guess from its name, assets are cached only when they are fetched from the server. `ServiceWorker` won't download them ahead of time.
